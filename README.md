# FOOS
FOOS (Free Organization Operating System) is a Free and Open Source Software designed to enable coordination of activities -- including procedures, processes, and other algorithmically representable patterns -- within organizations such as institutions, businesses, non-profits, clubs, etc. It is designed to be arbitrarily configurable and operable under extreme resource constraints such as low/intermittent bandwidth and low-spec smartphones or computers.

FOOS is similar in scope to software like Notion, Asana, or Google Keep, but is unique in both its intended use case and the constraints listed above that it is designed to operate within. It is also unique in that it is FOSS and in the digital sovereignty it provides users by allowing them to configure and self-host their own FOOS server.

By functioning as a simple interactive digital twin of an organization, it also can also act as a source of truth for roles and responsibilities (like an org chart). This also integrates with democratic processes within an organization. Various voting algorithms (arbitrarily programmable) can be used like quadratic voting and rank choice voting for deciding certain role assignments and/or voting on any topic. This is an optional feature but one that could be powerful especially when it is adapted through the evolutionary process as discussed later in the readme.

FOOS is just beginning its development process so many imagined features may change form, but the core purpose remains the same. Hopefully after reading the following example, you will see why this software solves some problems that no software we are aware of currently does. Our need to solve these problems is what motivates our development.

Example case: Farming on the shores of Lake Victoria in Port Victoria, Kenya.

An individual, let's call him Kwada, wants to start an irrigated agriculture on a plot of land that is connected to the shore of Lake Victoria. He envisions the irrigation system that will serve this plot of land as being potentially scaled to a many adjacent plots, forming a network similar in form to a municipal water distribution system.

This endeavor will involve many parties engaging in critical recurring coordinated processes. Let us first define the parties who are within the Organization (Kwada Farm) in this case.
  1. Kwada, who is himself not a farmer but is orchestrating and funding the system
  2. Farmer, who is doing all of the farm labor that is not contracted to other parties as one-off events
  3. Relative, who is keeping tabs on the whole operation to provide critical insights
  4. Researcher, who is interested in this application of agricultural technology as a case study

Whether FOOS is being used or not, each party as we said must engage in critical, often recurring, coordinated processes.
  1. Kwada must: optimize strategy, innovate, ensure legal compliance, pay Farmer, pay taxes, do accounting, document everything, and design contracts/agreements, reinvest profits, arrange maintanance, etc
  2. Farmer must: iteratively adjust irrigation system, weed, plant, harvest, count, take photos, log any activities (data collection), implement pest management strategy, upgrade life systems, etc
  3. Relative must: observe progress over time, provide input as needed
  4. Researcher must: ensure data collection is sufficient, access data and perform analyses, communicate with involved parties

FOOS allows the organizational structure and processes to be defined in one accessible application. These structures and processes in FOOS are called "Patterns." Granular access controls allow for pattern editing to be a constrained and intentional practice, ensuring that patterns are not as fragile as they might be in other applications. This aligns with the idea that FOOS is a way to ensure that an organization's critical procedures are being carried out. Rather than living in often ignored instruction sheets, internal policy documents, or destructable project management software checklists, procedures encoded in FOOS are interactive, protected, canonical, and auditable. FOOS is designed to enable auditability and observability of critical processes.

# Evolutionary Hypothesis

All organizational processes that humans employ are subject to and created by a mutation and selection based evolutionary process. This process occurs within the substrate of the stack of technologies being used. For example, amongst humans that are/were not using any writing, these processes for organization were mostly verbally encoded with the support of other types of symbolic or physical features. When the paper revolution came about, new types of institutional complexity became available. In the digital era, it still appears that many institutions operate using the same logic afforded to them by paper.

There are human coordination challenges whose problems now become: Could there in theory be system of FOOS patterns would make this possible? If so, what is it? By introducing a new evolutionary substrate for the processes of human coordination to evolve in a Darwinian manner that is also accelerated by the combinations of human and artificial intelligence used in pattern innovation, we hypothesize that just as seen in the result of evolutionary change in biological and economic systems, the resulting effects can solve problems that are collectively too large in scope for any individual intelligent being/system to solve. In other words, patterns that make the previously impossible possible become discoverable not by intelligence but by the natural processes that themselves produced intelligence.

Practically, this could look like a FOOS community evolving and sharing patterns that work over time which enable new institutional models and organizations that are able to outperform those using legacy coordination strategies. It could also look like coordinated action at scale under tight resource constraints that previously produced excessive friction.
