# FOOS
FOOS (Free Organization Operating System) enables coordination of activities -- including procedures, processes, and other algorithmically representable processes of human behavior. It is designed to be arbitrarily configurable and operable under resource constraints such as intermittent slow internet access and low-spec smartphones or computers.
